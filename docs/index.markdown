## 👋 Welcome to Chaotic Quant!

I'm Alain Daccache, and this is where I will document my journey in the domain of Artificial Intelligence. 

Having worked as
* 💻🏦 A Data Engineer in the banking space,
* 🛒📊 A Data Scientist in the retail space, 
* 🌐🔋 An AI consultant working with logistics, municipality, and energy entities

I had the opportunity to setup and operationalize their AI capabilities in different capacities
as well as learn how AI intersects in those domains.

With the recent boom of AI thanks to LLMs, many businesses are thriving to adopt AI in their operations. And unfortunately, the 
critical point I believe we're at demands more than just enthusiasm; without cultivating and establishing the right <u>culture</u>, <u>people</u>, <u>data</u>, 
<u>tools</u>, and <u>processes</u>, or understanding the business challenges and opportunities that could be solved by AI, its adoption won't reach 
its potential. We will only be inserting a square peg into a round hole until funding dries up and AI will be laid to rest among the other fields that were in a hype-cycle
since 2020.

To set your expectations, this will be a no-fluff website. I am not here to preach or prophesize. I am here to share actionable knowledge and aiming at:
1. **Asking the right business questions** by learning more about the following domains: Acounting & Finance, Supply Chain Management, Marketing & Sales, and Business Strategy.
2. **Tieing them with the appropriate analytical techniques**—from traditional methods like the Newsvendor model to cutting-edge neural networks.
3. **Ensuring they're adopted at scale** through technical (cloud infrastructure, Big Data tools, and backend/frontend technologies) and change management.

Note: While I'm talking about AI, none of the content in this website is generated by an LLM. It is wonderfully reviewed and stamped by my partner working tirelessly.
